# -- Still under construction

# Library for neural networks
 - all algebra-calculations are done on gpu
 - project will contain : DenseLayers, Convolutional Layers, Pooling Layers, Recurrent/LSTM Layers, Word Embeddings, Dropouts and some more
 - project currently contains: DenseLayers, Convolutional Layers, Pooling(undone)
 - build with g++ test.cpp -o ${filename} -l OpenCL -l pthread -l X11
 - you need opencl installed to run this application
